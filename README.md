# Embedded C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) peripheral driver development Based on STM32F411 microcontroller

Internship content summary To solve the problems such as poor maintainability and low code reuse rate faced by the traditional Procedural C development mode in large-scale firmware projects, multi-peripheral driver refactoring development is carried out based on STM32F411 to assist in debugging master-slave communication. Eventually, the modular and reusable driver development of multiple types of peripherals is achieved, providing technical support for the large-scale development of embedded firmware.

Specific responsibilities: Successively implemented FPU enabling, UART driver, and SPI and I2C driver development, covering core functions such as GPIO pin configuration, parameter configuration, data transmission and reception (8/16-bit data transmission, burst read/write), and completed the coding and testing of over 30 driver modules in total.
